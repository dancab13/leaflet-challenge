This repo contains files for the Module 15 Leaflet challenge. By opening the live server through the index.html file, you should see a Leaflet map pulling earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS data is of all earthquakes across the world within the past day.

The map visualizes the data using circle markers to represent the latitude and longitude of the earthquake's epicenter. The size of the marker corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude (the bigger the circle, the higher the magnitude). The color corresponds to the earthquake's depth (the darker the color, the deeper the epicenter).

All code is my own except where stated otherwise. I used the Leaflet tutorial on creating a chloropeth map to create the legend (the code in the CSS file for the legend is also from the tutorial). I used Stack Overflow and Xpert Learning Assistant to test concepts and get help.
